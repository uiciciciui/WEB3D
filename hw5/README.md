# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

I have modified the code to include three.js.

Right now, the code only allows clients connecting the server to toggle the 
rotation of a mesh.

Further development is planned.
